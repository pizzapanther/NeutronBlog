Version 14.10.2 was released today. This version introduces a login on application startup. This login can be disabled by going to your preferences or hitting the "skip forever" button when prompted to login. Right now the login is not used for anything; however, in the very near future, this login will be needed if you wish to use Neutron Beam. The new version of Neutron Beam will require an account so that we can securely store encryption keys that belong to you.
