If you haven't checked out the new version of Neutron Drive, [Super Neutron Drive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-neutron-drive/hjmodhnpiombojkgckmmhjhihfhphajp), you need to check it out today.  Today we released support for Google Drive with multiple accounts. Super Neutron Drive doesn't have all the features yet of its older sibling, but the redesigned architecture of the editor, allows us to support multiple Google Drive accounts seamlessly. Have code on your work and personal Google Drive? No problem! Access both in one editor.

By using the Chrome webview API with partitioning, Neutron is able to use the Google Drive API without mixing identities. This makes the Google multi account experience possible and easier than a normal web experience. In the future, this will also allow us to support other cloud platforms such as Dropbox. If you have a favorite cloud storage provider, please leave a comment so we know what to work on next.

**[Install Super Neutron Drive from the Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-neutron-drive/hjmodhnpiombojkgckmmhjhihfhphajp).**
