If you ever wanted to edit files via Dropbox or SFTP in Neutron Drive on Chrome OS, your ship has come in. With two new apps you can now mount Dropbox and SFTP so that you can edit files with either of these cloud services. Follow the steps below to get started.

1. Install one of the apps below.
1. Open the app and mount the file system.
1. Open Neutron Drive and add a Local Project.
1. Choose a location on your mounted file system.

In the future we will probably add direct support to mount file systems like this in Neutron Drive, but for now this gives you a quick hack that works well.
