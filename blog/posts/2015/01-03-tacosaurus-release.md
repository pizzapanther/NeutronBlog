Version 15.1.1 (Tacosaurus) was released to the Chrome Web Store today. This release introduces membership to Neutron Drive. Membership is a way you can help to support Neutron Drive development and maintenance. Membership is optional, but gives you access to escalated support and the ability vote on and submit features. You will also get your name in the Neutron Drive credits. If you would like to become a member sign up at our [members page](https://super.neutrondrive.com/members/).

In addition to membership, we also opened the [Neutron Gear Shop](http://neutron.spreadshirt.com/) where you can purchase t-shirts and other stuff that will help support Neutron Drive.

If you would like to see Neutron Drive continue, please consider supporting us via membership or by purchasing some Neutron Gear. It takes time and money to develop Neutron Drive and with your help we can continue to make Neutron Drive great.
