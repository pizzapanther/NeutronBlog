Cyber Roach includes two really cool features, spell checking and auto code complete. Both can be turned on and off in your preferences. However, spell checking can be quickly toggled on and off with `Alt-S`. Also auto code completion can still be used when turned off by using `Ctrl-Space` or `Alt-Space`. This allows you to leave the feature off if you dislike it but still allows you quick access to it if you want to use it occasionally.
